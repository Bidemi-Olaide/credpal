**CredPal Cypress Automated Testing**

## Overview
This repository contains automated tests written using Cypress, a modern end-to-end testing framework built for the web. Cypress provides fast, reliable, and easy-to-use testing for web applications. This README will guide you through setting up the project, running the tests, and understanding the project structure.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Access to the web application to be tested.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Writing Tests
Cypress tests are written in JavaScript and located in the `cypress/e2e` and `cypress/pageObjects` directory. Write your tests using the Cypress API. You can create new test files or modify existing ones to suit your requirements.

## Running Tests
To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run test
```

This command will launch Cypress and run all tests in headless mode by default. You can also open the Cypress Test Runner by running:

```bash
npm run test:open
```

## Folder Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- **cypress/e2e**: Contains test files written in JavaScript.
- **cypress/pageObjects**: Contains page object model files written in JavaScript.
- **cypress/fixtures**: Contains JSON files used as fixtures for test data.
- **cypress/support**: Contains custom commands and global configuration.
- **cypress/plugins**: Contains plugins used for extending Cypress functionality.
- **cypress/screenshots** and **cypress/videos**: Contains screenshots and videos of test runs, respectively.

## Continuous Integration
You can integrate this Cypress project with your CI/CD pipeline. Cypress provides various plugins and tools for integration with popular CI platforms like Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.
